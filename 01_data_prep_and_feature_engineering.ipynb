    "#### Why These Seasons (2015-2025)?\n",
    "I focused on the 2015-2025 seasons to capture the modern NBA era, when analytics-drive play and the 3-point revoluation reshaped the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start of the 3-Point Era** -> The Golden State Warriors, led by Stephen Curry, revolutionized basketball by showing how the 3-point shot could be the central weapon of an offense. Curry's unprecedented shooting range and efficiency reshaped defenses and forced every team to adjust. League-wide, average 3PA per game jumped from ~22 (2014) to ~27 (2015) and has continued to rise, with some teams now attempting 40+ threes per game. This dramatically affected the Effective FG% (eFG%).\n",
    "2. **Pace and Spacing Revolution** -> Teams shifted to small-ball, faster pace, and ball movement, elevating the importance of TOV% and ORB%.\n",
    "3. **Consistency with Advanced Metrics** -> From 2015 onward, the Four Factors (eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, DRB%, FT/FGA) became more stable predictors of success.\n",
    "4. **Reliable Data** -> Advanced play-by-play and team stats are cleaner and standardized post-2015.\n",
    "5. **Future-Proofing** -> Including 2025 ensures the model is tested against the most recent playoff trends.\n",

    "1. Load `Games.csv` and `TeamStatistics.csv` (playoff only).\n",
    "2. Assign playoff season.\n",
    "3. Compoute the **Four Factors** per game.\n",
    "4. Merge in opponent rebounds to calculate ORB% and DRB%.\n",
    "5. Attach home/away scores.\n",
    "6. Standardize team names.\n",
    "7. Keep only 2015-2025 seasons.\n",

    "These game-level playoff stats give the model real-time context. How teams actually performed in the pressure of the postseason, which is more predictive than relying only on regular season form. \n",
    "\n",
    "With these datasets: Regular season averages, playoff game stats, and head-to-head records, the model is equipped with both historical trends and series-specific context, allowing for more realistic playoff outcome predictions."
