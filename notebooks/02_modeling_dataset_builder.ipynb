    "## Predictive Modeling \n",
    "This notebook series builds predictive modeling datasets for **each round and game** of the NBA Playoffs from 2015–2025. Each stage of the playoffs presents unique strategic and statistical contexts, so we generate customized features for every round and game number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling Strategy by Round and Game\n",
    "Each playoff round and game required a tailored dataset based on game context and available stats. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Round 1**:\n",
    "  - *Game 1*: Regular season stats, seeding, head-to-head records.\n",
    "  - *Game 2*: Adds Game 1 results and momentum.\n",
    "  - *Games 3–7*: Uses rolling stats and current series score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rounds 2–4**:\n",
    "  - *Game 1*: Combines regular season and prior round averages, series length, and rest advantage.\n",
    "  - *Games 2–7*: Adds rolling stats from current round and series progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure ensures that features reflect real-world conditions as teams advance through the playoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Separate Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "By treating each round and game as a unique scenario, this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoids data leakage from future games\n",
    "- Accounts for strategic changes as series progress\n",
    "- Improves model realism and interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "This modular approach allows flexibility in choosing the most appropriate features and models depending on the playoff context."

    "#### Build Modeling Dataset - Round 1 Game 1\n",
    "This section generates the feature dataset for predicting outcomes of **Round 1 Game 1** matchups in the NBA Playoffs. It constructs team-level inputs by combining regular season stats, team seedings, head-to-head records, and home-court advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overview of Steps:\n",
    "1. **Import Data**: Read `team_statistics_regular_season.csv`and `team_statistics_playoff_games.csv` files.\n",
    "2. **Filter for Round 1, Game 1**: Select only playoff games that occurred in Round 1, Game 1 between 2015-2025.\n",
    "3. **Merge Regular Season Statistics**: Add regular season statistics for both the home and away teams using the Four Factors.\n",
    "4. **Rename Columns for Clarity**: Append `_home_season` or `_away_season` suffixes for clear team stat tracking.\n",
    "5. **Drop Redundant Columns**: Remove team name columns no longer needed after merging.\n",
    "6. **Select Features for Modeling**: Keep only relevant identifiers, game context, and statistical features.\n",
    "7. **Merge Head-to-Head Statistics**: Join in regular season head-to-head matchup data between the home and away teams."

    "##### Overview of Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Data**: Read `team_statistics_playoff_games.csv` and `playoffs_games.csv`.\n",
    "2. **Filter for Round 4 Games 2–7**: Keep seasons 2015–2025 and subset to Round 4 with `gameNumber > 1`.\n",
    "3. **Generate Rolling Round 4 Stats**: For each matchup, compute team rolling averages from **prior games in the same Round 4 series**  \n",
    "   (e.g., `eFG%`, `TOV%`, `FT/FGA`, `ORB%`, `DRB%`). Suffix features as `_home_r4_roll` and `_away_r4_roll`.\n",
    "4. **Track Series Status**: Add series context before the current game: `homeWins` and `awayWins` (wins to-date for each side).\n",
    "5. **Finalize Columns & Export**: Keep identifiers (`gameId`, `season`, `homeTeam`, `awayTeam`, `homeCourt`, `homeWin`, `round`, `gameNumber`),  \n",
    "   series status, and rolling features. Save to `modeling_round4_games2to7.csv`.\n"
