    "## Predictive Modeling by Round and Game\n",

    "This approach ensures that models:  \n",
    "- Avoid **data leakage** by only using information available before each game.  \n",
    "- Reflect **real-world playoff strategy** (e.g., rest days, momentum, series score).  \n",

    "Playoff basketball is highly contextual.  \n",
    "A Game 1 in Round 1 looks very different from a Game 6 in the Finals:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Round 1 Game 1** → Teams rely mostly on regular season form, seeding, and head-to-head history.  \n",
    "- **Round 1 Game 2** → Momentum from Game 1 matters; team adjustments begin.  \n",
    "- **Games 3–7** → Series score and rolling performance stats become more predictive.  \n",
    "- **Later Rounds (2–4)** → Fatigue, rest advantage, and prior series length play a larger role.  \n",

    "By tailoring features for each context, the model better mirrors how **real teams adjust strategies across the playoffs.**\n",
